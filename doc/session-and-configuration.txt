Session and configuration
===

RhoConnect persists user session in a cookie which is handled by client executable. But some client may have an issue accessing a session cookie value due to platform security features involved.

At this moment well-known clients with such restrictions are Rhoconnect.js, Rhodes and ObjectiveC client on WinPhone7 platform.

To overcome cookie issue the *XDomainSessionWrapper* Rack middleware has been implemented and included to the RhoConnect distribution.
You can find it inside RhoConnect gem in *lib/rhoconnect/middleware/x_domain_session_wrapper.rb* file.

## How to use

To use this workaround just put these lines in config.ru file right before *Rhoconnect::Server* settings:

    :::ruby
    require 'rhoconnect/x_domain_session_wrapper'
    use XDomainSessionWrapper, \
        :session_cookie => 'rhoconnect_session', \
        :api_uri_regexp => /\A\/(api\/)?application/, \
        :login_uri_regexp => /\A\/(api\/)?application\/clientlogin/

It just a sample, use real base URL values there. By default it configured just for URLs based on */api/application* pattern, not */application*.

**NOTE: Without mentioned configuration you may have login errors for Rhoconnect.js client and Rhodes application on WinPhone7 platform if your application points RhoConnect server as 'http://some-address.com/application'.
